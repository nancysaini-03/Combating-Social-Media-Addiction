### 🔍Key Insights

 - While average daily social media usage remains generally balanced across genders, a subtle trend emerges: females consistently show slightly higher usage in several age groups (e.g., 18, 19, 21, 22, and 24). However, this pattern reverses at ages 20 and 23, where males report marginally higher usage. Interestingly, this coincides with slightly lower average mental health scores (by 0.2–0.3 points) for males compared to females in those same age groups.
 - Some platforms(LINE, LinkedIn, Vkontakte) don't affect Academic performance having nearly good average sleeping cycle. Majority of these platforms do not significantly influence grades, except for KakaoTalk and WhatsApp, which may cause distractions due to frequent notifications. Students need to reduce their screen time as their sleeping habit is being drastically impacted by some apps(Snapchat, Whatspp and youtube) with an average of 5.7 hours, which will lead to poor health in long run.
 - India has the highest level of addiction, accounting for 56.4% of the total population analyzed.
 - Students aged 18 show the highest addiction levels (7.7), lowest average sleep (5.5 hours), and poorest mental health (5.21), likely due to academic pressures, social challenges, and increased digital engagement disrupting sleep and well-being.
 - High Schoolers tend to be more addictive of social media, covering 38.7% of the total proportion.
